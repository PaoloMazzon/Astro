# Fixed Timestep
![example](example.gif)

This demo has lots of different things including fixed-timestep gameplay.
There is also level loading, basic entity physics, and 3D models. The
timestep runs at 30 frames per second but the player position is interpolated
to make the game seem smooth regardless of physics updates.
